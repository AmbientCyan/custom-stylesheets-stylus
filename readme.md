# Custom Stylesheets for Stylus

This is a dump of some custom CSS stylesheets I have made for a few sites for Stylish/Stylus. Some of these may be unfinished, but most uploaded here should be enough for most pages on what they apply to. 

### Evening Reddit

**evening-reddit.css** - A dark theme for pre-redesign reddit. Turn off subreddit styles for this to work.

### Improved Discord Light Theme

**discord-improved-night-theme.css** - A light theme for discord that doesn't look like you are staring into the sun.

### ArchWiki Night

**arch-wiki-night.css** - A darker theme for the arch linux wiki that tries to keep consistent with the style of the rest of the site.
